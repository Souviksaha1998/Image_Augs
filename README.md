##  ‚ÑπÔ∏è Description:

This is a augemntation tool for Object Detection , Image classification and Instance Segmentation , it can perform 12+ annotations. The important ones are rotation, affine, zooming in and out, noise, and blur. The augmentations can be applied to a fraction of the data (40 - 50 percent of the images out of 100 can be augmented).When rotating or zooming in and out, the bounding box coordinates will also change as the image is rotated or zoomed.

***
##  üöÄ Let's Start.. 
#### üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Create a virtual environment (OPTIONAL)

```python
pip install virtualenv
python3 -m venv <your env name>

#activate the environment --> for linux user
source <your env name>/bin/activate

#activate the environment  --> for windows user
<your env name>/Source/activate.ps1
```

#### üë©üèº‚Äçüíª Clone the repository ‚§µÔ∏è
```python
git clone https://github.com/Souviksaha1998/Image_Augs.git
cd Image_Augs
```
#### üöÄ Install the requirements.txt file
```python
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

#### üéØ Next run this..
```python
streamlit run app.py
```
#### You'll able to see a inferface like this ‚§µÔ∏è

## Steps to follow ‚§µÔ∏è
<img src='images/project_name.png'>

**Provide a name for the project and click on --***Next***-- and you will see a --***SUCCESS***-- message**


<img src='images/augs.png'>

**Select project type ***(FOR NOW ONLY SUPPORTED PROJECT TYPE IS --DETECTION--)*** and click on CONTINUE.**

<img src='images/path.png'>

**You need to provide ***FULL PATH*** of the data ***(RELATIVE PATH WON'T WORK)*****

<img src='images/resize.png'>

**Resize Image**

<img src='images/split.png'>

**Split into train and test dataset, You will able to see ***TOTAL IMAGES , TRAIN IMAGES , TEST IMAGES*** in numbers.**

<img src='images/effects.png'>

**Select augmentations you want to apply on your images and click ***FIRE UP AUGMENTATIONS*****

    - LOW VALUE        -> STARTING VALUE OF AN AUGMENTATION.
    - HIGH VALUE       -> ENDING VALUE OF AUGMENTATION, YOU MUST SELECT A VALUE (LOW TO HIGH WILL ACT AS A RANGE).
    - FRACTION OF DATA -> YOU SELECTED 0.30 MEANS OUT OF 100 IMAGES RANDOM 30% DATA YOU WILL BE SELECTED FOR A PARTICULAR AUGMENTATION.
    - INFO             -> YOU WILL ABLE TO SEE, OUT OF TOTAL TRAIN IMAGES HOW MANY IMAGES WILL BE AFFECTED BY A PARTICULAR AUGMENTATION.
    
### üöÄ Next, click on - *AUGMENT DATA* -
